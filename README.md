## Installation
Simply clone it and put on your (remote/local) server.
## Usage
Long story short you search for the items or add them using the Add By URL option. You can then ping the Steam Market servers to get the current lowest price of said items every "Frequency" value. You can also set up notifications by inputting your desired price in "Minimum Notification Price". When the current price reaches or gets below that value, you get notified.

All items you add to/remove from the list will also get added to/removed from the localStorage if Auto Storage is checked. If you have anything in the localStorage, the app will ask you whether you want to use them on the page reload.
Buttons in the navigation bar, bulk options and Auto Storage checkbox give you full control over what's in your localStorage.

Be careful when pinging often or pinging many items since Steam Market is pretty trigger happy when it comes to time outs nowadays.

Full How-To available in the app itself. "Help" is what you want to click.
